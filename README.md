# Deploying_a_Sentiment_Analysis_Model_Using_AWS_SageMaker
 Did this project as a part of requirements for graduation of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.	Constructed a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) on top of an embedding layer and trained it on the BOW encoded IMDB dataset containing movie review for detecting sentiment of a movie review. Created the training job, model and deployed the model on AWS SageMaker service. Gave access of the deployed model to a simple web app that can take input review as text from an user and give the sentiment of the review as output by creating a Lambda function and API Gateway and giving the web app access to the API Gateway.
