# Deploying_a_Sentiment_Analysis_Model_Using_AWS_SageMaker
 Dis this project as a part of requirements for graduation of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. Constructed a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) on top of an embedding layer and trained it on the BOW wncoded IMDB dataset containing movie review for detecting sentiment of amovie review. Created the training job, model and deployed the model on AWS SageMaker service. Gave acsses of the deployed model to a smiple web app that can take inpur review as text from an user and give the sentiment of the review as output by creating a Lambda function and API Gateway and giving the web app access to the API Gateway.
